  "content": "Claims quality assurance traditionally requires extensive manual review of claim decisions, documentation, and processes. This PoC showcases how AI can automatically analyze claim scenarios, detect potential issues, and provide quality insights. The system simulates real-world claim scenarios with different loss types and provides AI-driven QA analysis to help ensure consistent, accurate, and compliant claims processing. \n\nIn production, when an action on a claim is taken by the adjuster, ECS should trigger an event that sends information to the QA Agent. The QA Agent's response should be sent back to ECS, and the adjuster should be able to see the QA Agent's response in the UI as a notification."
