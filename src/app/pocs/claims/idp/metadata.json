  "content": "The Claims Classification PoC demonstrates how AI can be used to automatically classify incoming insurance claims documents and extract key information, addressing the inefficiency and error-prone nature of manual classification.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. When a new claim document is uploaded, OCR extracts the text while the system analyzes both text and visual elements to determine document type.\n\n2. Three different approaches were validated:\n   - BERT+ResNet: Combined NLP and image analysis (70% accuracy)\n   - LayoutLMv2: Transformer model incorporating document structure (100% accuracy, given the right data)\n   - Agentic LLM workflow: Multi-agent setup with task breakdown (90% accuracy, highly scalable)\n\n3. The system extracts relevant information including policyholder details, claim numbers, and document content using either machine learning or LLM approaches, depending on the document type.\n\n4. For multi-page documents, similar pages are clustered to optimize processing time and improve results.\n\nBusiness Benefits:\n\n- 50%+ reduction in document processing time\n- 90%+ classification accuracy\n- Consistent handling of claims across the organization\n- Better resource allocation based on claim complexity and priority\n- Improved customer experience through faster claims resolution"
