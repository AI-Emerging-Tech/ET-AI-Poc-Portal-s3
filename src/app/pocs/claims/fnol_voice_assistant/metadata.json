  "content": "Traditional FNOL (First Notice of Loss) processes require customers to navigate complex phone trees or fill out lengthy forms. This PoC showcases a revolutionary voice-first approach where customers can report claims naturally through conversation with an AI assistant. The system combines Speech-to-Text (STT), advanced conversational AI, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) in a seamless streaming pipeline. \n\nThe voice assistant guides users through the claim reporting process, asks clarifying questions, and provides immediate feedback - all through natural speech interaction. The streaming architecture ensures minimal latency, with audio responses beginning to play before the complete response is generated."
