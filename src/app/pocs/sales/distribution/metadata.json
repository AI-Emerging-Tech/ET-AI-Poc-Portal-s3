  "content": "The Distribution Chat is an intelligent conversational interface that allows users to easily access information from insurance distribution documents without having to search through extensive files. This solution leverages advanced AI technologies through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which combines the power of large language models with a knowledge base built from uploaded distribution documents.How it works:\n\n1. When you upload documents and ask a question, the system searches through a database of distribution-related content to find the most relevant information.\n\n2. The system uses two AI frameworks (LangChain and LangGraph) with intelligent agent-based orchestration to process your query and dynamically route it to the right tools for retrieval.\n\n3. The AI then generates a comprehensive, contextually relevant response based on the retrieved information rather than just general knowledge.\n\n4. The system maintains conversation history, allowing for follow-up questions and a more natural dialogue experience.\n\nThis solution demonstrates how AI can be practically applied to streamline distribution processes and enhance internal knowledge workflows through intelligent, tool-aware conversations."
